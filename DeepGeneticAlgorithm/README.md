# Deep Genetic Algorithm
In this approach to keyboard optimization, we expand upon the MKLOGA method and use a genetic algorithm for evolving high scoring layouts.
For the sake of computational efficiency, a deep neural network is also added to this genetic algorithm as a faster surrogate model of the true keyboard metrics.
